# AudioTheme Medley

Assorted enhancements for themes built by AudioTheme. Functionality that isn't essential to the design or use of themes will be bundled in this add-on.


## Features

### Add a Favicon

To upload a favicon, visit the Customizer (**Appearance &rarr; Customize**), open the **Site Title & Tagline** section, and upload an image in the **Favicon** setting.

For best results, upload a transparent PNG that is 32 pixels wide by 32 pixels high. Medley will automatically generate an ICO file containing a 16x16 icon and a 32x32 icon for HiDPI devices.


### Modify Credits

To change the theme credits, visit the Customizer (**Appearance &rarr; Customize**), open the **Theme Credits** section, and add some text to the **Credits Text** field. You may also choose whether your custom text appears before, after, or replaces the default credits.

*Tip: Insert {{year}} in your text to have the year update automatically.*


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why a plugin?

Certain non-essential features require a fair bit of boilerplate code that has to be duplicated across themes. A plugin allows us to centralize the code and improve the overall experience.
