# AudioTheme Medley

Assorted enhancements for themes built by AudioTheme. Functionality that isn't essential to the design or use of themes will be bundled in this add-on.


## Features

### Modify Credits

To change the theme credits, visit the Theme Customizer (**Appearance &rarr; Customize**), open the **Theme Credits** section, and add some text to the **Credits Text** field. You may also choose whether your custom text appears before, after, or replaces the default credits.

*Tip: Insert {{year}} in your text to have the year update automatically.*


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why a plugin?

Certain non-essential features require a fair bit of boilerplate code that has to be duplicated across themes. A plugin allows us to centralize the code and improve the overall experience.
